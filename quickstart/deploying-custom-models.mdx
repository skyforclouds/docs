title: 'Deploying Custom Models'
description: 'Deploy your custom models to SoraNova'
---

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- âœ… Access to your webconsole instance (as root user)
- âœ… Docker installed on your webconsole instance

## Push your model image

Suppose you have a custom model image that you want to deploy to SoraNova. You should first pull the image to your webconsole instance.

```shell
docker login <your-custom-model-registry>
docker pull <your-custom-model-image>
```

For example, if you have a custom model image hosted on `docker.soracloud.net`, you can pull it with the following command:

```shell
docker login docker.soracloud.net # if your registry is private
docker pull docker.soracloud.net/your-custom-model-image:latest
```

Then, you can seed your custom model with the following command:

```shell
# This command pushes your custom image to your SoraNova registry
sora image push <your-custom-model-image> <your-custom-model-image-name>:<your-custom-model-image-tag>
# e.g.
# sora image push docker.soracloud.net/your-custom-model-image:latest your-custom-model-image:latest
```

> The `sora` CLI is a command-line interface used to interact with your SoraNova instance. If you havenâ€™t installed it yet, follow the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart).


## Define the deployment recipe

You can deploy it by creating a new recipe by creating a `model.hcl` file with the following contents:

<Warning>
The deployment configuration DSL shown below is experimental and subject to change in future releases.
</Warning>

```hcl
# ----- Variables Block: Defines variables that can be customized during deployment -----

# Amount of RAM (in MiB) allocated to the model container
variable "memory_mib" {
  type        = number
  description = "Memory allocation in MiB for the model task"
  default     = 14360
}

# GPU device name (e.g., 'nvidia/gpu')
variable "gpu_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "GPU name for the model task"
  default     = "nvidia/gpu"
}

# List of GPU memory allocations (in MiB) â€” one per GPU device
variable "gpu_memory_mibs" {
  type        = list(number)
  description = "GPU memory allocation in MiB for the model task"
  default     = [20480, 20480]
}

# Strategy for GPU sharing â€” 'mps' enables CUDA MPS for multi-process sharing
variable "sharing_strategy" {
  type        = string
  description = "GPU sharing strategy for the model task"
  default     = "mps"
}

# Number of replicas (i.e., how many copies of the model to run)
variable "replica_count" {
  type        = number
  description = "Number of replicas for the model task"
  default     = 1
}

# ----- Application Block: Defines the application configuration -----
application {
  name        = "My Custom Model"  # Display name of your application
  summary     = "https://huggingface.co/your-company/custom-model"  # Optional link to model card or docs
  description = "Adding of a custom model"  # Short description of this deployment

  # Define a service named "model"
  service "model" {
    name = "your-model"  # Internal service name used for routing and discovery.

    # Define a task group to run one or more identical tasks (replicas)
    task_group "model" {
      count = "${var.replica_count}"  # Number of replicas to launch

      task {
        name   = "your-model-name"  # Unique name for the task
        driver = "docker"           # Use Docker as the container runtime

        config {
          image    = "your-custom-model-image:latest"  # Docker image to run
          ipc_mode = "host"                            # Share IPC namespace with host (Optional - useful for some GPU workloads)
          args     = [
            "--host", "0.0.0.0",                       # Pass args the image needs
            "--port", "5000"
          ]
        }

        # Define an endpoint for the model server
        endpoint llm {
          port = 5000  # Port exposed by the model

          health {                    # Health check - used to determine when the service is up and healthy
            type     = "http"         # Health check type (HTTP-based)
            path     = "/health"      # Path used for liveness check
            interval = "10s"          # How often to check health
            timeout  = "2s"           # How long to wait before marking as unhealthy
          }
        }

        # Declare the hardware and resource requirements
        resources {
          cpu_mhz    = 10240  # CPU requested for this task (in MHz)
          memory_mib = "${var.memory_mib}"  # Memory allocated to the task

          sharing_strategy = "${var.sharing_strategy}"  # GPU sharing strategy

          device {
            name        = "${var.gpu_name}"  # GPU device name
            memory_mibs = "${var.gpu_memory_mibs}"  # GPU memory for each device
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```
<Note>`health` needs to be defined by the image to tell SoraNova how to check if the model is healthy.</Note>

## Deploy and Interact

To deploy the model:

```shell
sora recipe seed model.hcl
sora recipe list
sora recipe deploy <recipe-slug> # replace with the slug from the previous command
```

After deployment, list your models using:

```shell
sora model list
```

<Note>If your model has a `/openapi.json` endpoint, you can inspect it's API using `sora model api <model-slug>`.</Note>

ðŸŽ‰ Thatâ€™s it â€” your model is now live and ready to serve requests. Happy building!
