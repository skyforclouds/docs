## What is a Daemon Job?

Daemon jobs are background services that run on every node in your SoraNova cluster. They are ideal for log shippers, monitoring agents, or any persistent process that should be present on all nodes.


---

## Example: Deploying a Log Shipping Daemon

Below is a sample configuration for deploying [Vector](https://vector.dev/) as a log shipper daemon. This will collect logs from `/var/log` and Docker, and can be configured to push them to an external HTTP endpoint or print them to the console.

```hcl
daemon {
  name = "vector"

  config {
    image = "timberio/vector:latest-debian"

    volumes = [
      "/var/log:/var/log:ro"
    ]

    args = [
      "--config-dir", "/local/etc/vector"
    ]
  }

  template {
    data = <<EOF
[sources.my_source]
type = "file"
include = ["/var/log/**/*.log"]
fingerprint.strategy = "device_and_inode"

[sources.docker_logs]
type = "docker_logs"

# To push logs to a HTTP endpoint, uncomment and set the uri:
# [sinks.my_sink]
# type = "http"
# inputs = ["my_source", "docker_logs"]
# uri = "https://your-log-endpoint"
# encoding.codec = "json"

[sinks.my_sink]
type = "console"
inputs = ["my_source", "docker_logs"]
encoding.codec = "json"

EOF

    destination = "/local/etc/vector/vector.toml"
  }

  resources {
    cpu_mhz    = 100
    memory_mib = 1024
  }
}
```

## Key Points

- **Daemon jobs run on every node**: Use them for log collection, monitoring, or any background process.
- **Customizable sinks**: You can ship logs to an internal HTTP endpoint by editing the `template` block (see the commented section in the example).
- **Resource allocation**: Use the `resources` block to control CPU and memory usage.

---

## Deploying the Daemon

1. Save the above configuration to a file, e.g. `vector-daemon.hcl`.
2. Deploy it using the SoraNova CLI:

    ```bash
    sora recipe seed vector-daemon.hcl
    sora recipe list
    sora recipe deploy <recipe-slug>
    ```

3. The daemon will now run on every node in your cluster.

---

## Advanced: Shipping Logs to an Endpoint

To push logs to an **internal HTTP endpoint**, edit the `template` block as follows:

```toml
[sinks.my_sink]
type = "http"
inputs = ["my_source", "docker_logs"]
uri = "https://your-log-endpoint" # or "http://your-log-endpoint" if internal endpoint
encoding.codec = "json"
```


Uncomment and adjust these lines in your `template` block, setting the `uri` to your log aggregation service (internal or external).

ðŸŽ‰ That's it! You now have a background daemon running on every node in your SoraNova cluster.
