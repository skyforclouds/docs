description: 'Integrating Sora-deployed models with OpenAI SDK'
---

#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have a successfully deployed Sora model as per the previous section.

Obtain the `BASE_URL` and `BEARER_TOKEN` from the API page as follows.

```bash
curl 'https://llm-api-66414768.sora-h26.soracloud.org/v1/chat/completions' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer 2f482a3f-ee14-4bdd-ab21-1782dd7e8890' \
...
```

In this case, the respective values to take note would be:
- `BEARER_TOKEN`: 2f482a3f-ee14-4bdd-ab21-1782dd7e8890
- `BASE_URL`: https://llm-api-66414768.sora-h26.soracloud.org/v1

    <Tab title="Python">
        Install OpenAI Python package:
        ```bash
        pip install openai
        ```

        With the OpenAI SDK installed, create a file called example.py and copy the example code into it:
        ```python
        from openai import OpenAI
        client = OpenAI(base_url=<BASE_URL>, api_key=<BEARER_TOKEN>)

        completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="sora-amazing-model",
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
                }
            ],
            stream=True,
        )
        for chunk in completion:
            print(chunk.choices[0].delta)
        ```
        
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="JavaScript">
        Install OpenAI Node.js package:
        ```bash
        npm install openai
        ```

        With the OpenAI SDK installed, create a file called example.js and copy the example code into it:
        ```javascript
        import OpenAI from "openai";
        const client = new OpenAI({
            baseURL: "<BASE_URL>",
            apiKey: "<BEARER_TOKEN>"
        });

        const stream = await client.chat.completions.create({

                },
            ],
            stream: true,
        });

        for await (const chunk of stream) {
            console.log(chunk);
            console.log(chunk.choices[0].delta);
            console.log("****************");
