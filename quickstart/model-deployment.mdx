#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- An active Workspace set up on the SoraNova [Dashboard](https://portal.soranova.ai)

To get started with the SoraNova CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://releases.s4c.ai/cli/install_cli.sh | sh
```

This will install the latest version of the SoraNova CLI on your system.


### Add your workspace


```bash
sora workspace add demo https://demo.soracloud.org
```

### Deploy a model
To deploy a model from the model library, you can run: 
```bash
sora recipe list # view all recipes you can deploy
sora recipe deploy llama-3-1-8b-instruct
```
<Note>
A recipe is a pre-configured template for deploying images on your infrastructure.
</Note>

### Interface with the model
Once the model is deployed, you can verify it's status by running `sora model list`. To query the model via it's API, you can refer to this [API reference](/api-reference/introduction.mdx).

ðŸŽ‰ You're all set! Start building amazing things with your deployed models.
