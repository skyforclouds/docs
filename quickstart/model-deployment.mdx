#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- An active Workspace set up on the SoraNova [Dashboard](https://portal.soranova.ai)

To get started with the SoraNova CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://releases.s4c.ai/cli/install_cli.sh | sh
```

This will install the latest version of the SoraNova CLI on your system.


### Add your workspace


```bash
sora workspace add demo https://demo.soracloud.org
```

<Note>
  You can obtain your workspace's magic link from this [dashboard](https://portal.soranova.ai).
</Note>

### Deploy a model
To deploy a model from the model library, you can run: 
```bash
sora recipe list # view all recipes you can deploy
sora recipe deploy llama-3-1-8b-instruct
```
<Note>
A recipe is a pre-configured template for deploying images on your infrastructure.
</Note>

### Interface with the model
Once the model is deployed, you can verify it's status by running `sora model list`. To query the model via it's API, you can run:

```bash
sora model list
sora model api <your-model-slug> # copy the slug from the output from above
```
and it should generate you a curl like this:
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://llama-8b-43112745.demo.soranova.net/v1/chat/completions' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer 04a8f35e-0cc8-4496-9f2d-3761b23640ea' \
  -d '{
  "max_tokens": 2048,
  "messages": [
    {
        "content": "<STRING>",
        "role": "user"
      }
  ],
  "model": "<STRING>",
  "stream": false,
  "temperature": 0.6
}'
```

ðŸŽ‰ You're all set! Start building amazing things with your deployed models.
