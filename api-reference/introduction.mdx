{/* ## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

<Card
  title="Plant Store Endpoints"
  icon="leaf"
  href="https://github.com/mintlify/starter/blob/main/api-reference/openapi.json"
>
  View the OpenAPI specification file
</Card> */}

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file. **Remember that your token is a secret!** Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Tokens should be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service on the server.

Tokens should be provided via [HTTP Bearer authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/authentication/bearer-authentication/).

```
Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY
```
