## Variable Declaration

Variables define dynamic values that can be reused throughout the deployment.

```hcl
variable "memory_mib" {
  type        = number
  description = "Memory allocation in MiB for the model task"
  default     = 14360
}
```

| Keyword       | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `variable`    | Declares a reusable value block                              |
| `type`        | Specifies the type (`number`, `string`, `list`, etc.)        |
| `description` | Describes what this variable is used for                     |
| `default`     | Provides a fallback value if none is given at deploy time    |

<Tip>
Reference variables with `${var.variable_name}` in your task or resource definitions.
</Tip>

## Application Block

The `application` block is the top-level definition for a model deployment.

```hcl
application {
  name        = "My Custom Model"
  summary     = "https://huggingface.co/your-company/model"
  description = "A custom model deployment"
}
```

| Keyword       | Purpose                                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | Human-readable name for your model             |
| `summary`     | Link to model card or documentation (optional) |
| `description` | A short description of your deployment         |

---

## Service and Task Group

Define a `service` to a logical group together model execution tasks. 

```hcl
service "model" {
  name = "your-model"

  task_group "model" {
    count = "${var.replica_count}"

    task {
      name   = "your-model-name"
      driver = "docker"
      config { ... }
    }
  }
}
```

| Keyword        | Purpose                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------   |
| `service`      | Groups all tasks that serve a single model                 |
| `task_group`   | Defines how many replicas of a task to run                 |
| `count`        | Sets the number of replicas (use a variable if needed)     |
| `task`         | A single unit of execution (a container or script)         |
| `driver`       | The runtime environment, e.g., `docker`                    |
| `config`       | The configuration of your task, see below                  |

---

## Task Config

Configure how your model container should be launched.

```hcl
config {
  image    = "your-custom-model-image:latest"
  ipc_mode = "host"
  args     = ["--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "5000"]
}
```

| Keyword     | Purpose                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `image`     | Docker image to launch                                |
| `ipc_mode`  | Set to `host` if your container requires GPU IPC      |
| `args`      | Command-line arguments passed to your container       |

---

## Endpoint & Health Check

Specify the modelâ€™s serving port and health check mechanism.

```hcl
endpoint llm {
  port = 5000

  health {
    type     = "http"
    path     = "/health"
    interval = "10s"
    timeout  = "2s"
  }
}
```

| Keyword    | Purpose                                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `endpoint` | Exposes a port for requests and defines health checks     |
| `port`     | Port that the model will serve traffic on                 |
| `health`   | Block that determines if the container is "healthy"       |
| `type`     | Health check type (`http`)                                |
| `path`     | HTTP path to hit for health checking                      |
| `interval` | How often to check the health                             |
| `timeout`  | Timeout for each health check attempt                     |

<Warning>
  Ensure the health check path is correctly implemented in your model.
  If the health check fails, the model may not be marked as healthy.
</Warning>

## Resources and GPU Allocation

Declare CPU, memory, and GPU resources for your task.

```hcl
resources {
  cpu_mhz          = 10240
  memory_mib       = "${var.memory_mib}"
  sharing_strategy = "${var.sharing_strategy}"

  device {
    name        = "${var.gpu_name}"
    memory_mibs = "${var.gpu_memory_mibs}"
  }
}
```

| Keyword           | Purpose                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cpu_mhz`         | How much CPU to allocate (in MHz)                        |
| `memory_mib`      | RAM allocated to this task                               |
| `sharing_strategy`| GPU usage model (`mps` for CUDA Multi-Process Service)   |
| `device`          | GPU allocation block                                     |
| `name`            | GPU device name (e.g., `nvidia/gpu`)                     |
| `memory_mibs`     | Memory to allocate per GPU (MiB)                         |

## Sample Deployment Flow

```bash
# 1. Seed the model recipe
sora recipe seed model.hcl

# 2. View the available recipes
sora recipe list

# 3. Deploy the model using its slug
sora recipe deploy <recipe-slug>
```
